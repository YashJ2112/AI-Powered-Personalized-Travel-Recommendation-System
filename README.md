# AI-Powered-Personalized-Travel-Recommendation-System
Building AI course project

## Summary
This project aims to develop a personalized travel recommendation system that suggests vacation destinations based on user preferences and travel history using machine learning. The model considers factors like budget, weather preferences, and activity interests.

## Background
Travel planning can be overwhelming, especially with the abundance of options available online. This system will help travelers by filtering through millions of potential vacation spots and suggesting tailored recommendations based on personal preferences.

**Problems addressed:**
* Overwhelming number of choices for vacation destinations
* Lack of personalized travel suggestions based on individual preferences
* Inefficient travel planning process

This problem is common among frequent travelers, and as someone who loves travel but finds planning time-consuming, I'm motivated to create a tool that simplifies the process.

## How is it used?
The user inputs their preferences, such as budget, weather, preferred activities, and previous travel experiences. The system then processes the input using machine learning algorithms and suggests a list of destinations. It’s useful for travel agencies or individuals planning vacations.

Here’s how the workflow might look:

1. User inputs preferences (e.g., budget, preferred weather, activities).
2. The system runs the inputs through a trained recommendation model.
3. Output: A list of vacation spots tailored to the user's preferences.

## Data sources and AI methods
**Data Sources:**
* User travel history
* OpenWeather API for weather data
* TripAdvisor or similar datasets for destination reviews and activity ratings

**AI Methods:**
* Machine learning (collaborative filtering) for personalized recommendations
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing reviews
* Clustering techniques to group similar destinations

## Challenges
This project does not handle real-time updates for sudden changes like weather or flight cancellations. Ethical considerations include user privacy in collecting and storing travel preferences and histories.

## What next?
The system can grow by including flight and accommodation options in the recommendations, possibly integrating it with booking platforms. To move forward, assistance from experienced data scientists and access to larger travel datasets would be needed.
